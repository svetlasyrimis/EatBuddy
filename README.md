A section clearly defining MVP and POST MVP.
## Feature List 
List of pieces of functionality of the app.
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) diagram of the database tables, schemas, and relations. You can draw them by hand or try on of these useful links for ERDs:

* [lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) This is a great tool for building ERDs.
* [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) Another great tool for ERDs.
* [ERDPlus](https://erdplus.com/#/) Yet another great tool for ERDS.

##Wireframes 
Sketches of the user interface with notes of how the user will interact with the UI.
##React Component Heirarchy 
Wireframes should be broken into components which then should be described in a component heirarchy.
